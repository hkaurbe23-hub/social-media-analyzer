## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

**Component-Based Design:** React functional components with hooks for state management, ensuring maintainable and reusable code architecture.

**File Processing Pipeline:** 
- `react-dropzone` handles file uploads with validation
- Mock text extraction simulates real-world OCR (Tesseract) and PDF parsing
- Realistic processing delays provide authentic user experience

**AI Integration Strategy:**
- Designed for Google Gemini API integration
- Mock responses demonstrate engagement scoring algorithm
- Contextual suggestion generation based on content analysis

**State Management:**
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`) for local state
- Proper cleanup with `URL.revokeObjectURL` prevents memory leaks
- Error boundaries ensure graceful failure handling

### Performance Optimizations

- **Tailwind CDN:** Eliminates build complexity while maintaining styling performance
- **Code Splitting:** Vite handles automatic optimization and bundling
- **Lazy Loading:** Components load efficiently with proper React patterns
- **Memory Management:** Proper cleanup of file URLs and event listeners

### User Experience Features

- **Progressive Disclosure:** Features appear as users progress through workflow
- **Loading States:** Comprehensive feedback during all async operations
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## 🤖 AI Features (Mock Implementation)

### Engagement Scoring Algorithm
The scoring system analyzes multiple content factors:
- **Hashtag Usage:** +1.5 points for relevant hashtags
- **Emoji Presence:** +1.2 points for visual appeal
- **Interactive Elements:** +0.8 points for questions
- **Call-to-Actions:** +1.0 points for engagement prompts
- **Content Length:** +0.8 points for optimal length (15-80 words)
- **Storytelling:** +0.7 points for personal narratives

### Content Analysis
- **Sentiment Detection:** Analyzes emotional tone and positivity
- **Engagement Prediction:** Estimates viral potential based on content patterns
- **Optimization Suggestions:** Contextual recommendations for improvement

### Multi-Tone Rewriting
- **Casual Tone:** Friendly, approachable language for personal brands
- **Professional Tone:** Business-appropriate content for corporate accounts
- **Excited Tone:** High-energy content for maximum engagement
